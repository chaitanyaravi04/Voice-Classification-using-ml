Speech recognition is one of the fastest-growing engineering technologies. It has several applications in different areas, and provides many potential benefits. A lot of people are unable to communicate due to language barriers. We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. 
    This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words. Neural machine translation is the primary algorithm used in the industry to perform machine translation. 
    Audio classification has very large theoretical and practical values in both pattern recognition and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel audio classification method based on machine learning technique. Firstly, we illustrate the hierarchical structure of audio data, which is made up of four layers: 1) Audio frame, 2) Audio clip, 3) Audio shot, and 4) Audio high level semantic unit. Secondly, three types of audio data feature are extracted to construct feature vector, including 1) Short time energy, 2) Zero crossing rate and 3) Mel-Frequency cepstral coefficients. Thirdly, we discuss how to classify audio data using the SVM classifier with Gaussian kernel. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to achieve higher audio classification accuracy.
